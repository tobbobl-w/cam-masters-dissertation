# @time RetirementLifecycleWithIncome()

# How many times does this need to run? 200 not too bad
# each run will take about 50 mins

# Now we want to plot consumption paths
# Dont have a consumption floor but I dont think this matters because we dont have stochastic income?

# I should do a run with a finer grid and see how much longer it takes
# I think I should only need to run for one set of year-age combos.
# surely
