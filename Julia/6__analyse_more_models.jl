# And we have people who are too poor to annutise their optimal amount

# is this vecuase people ahve not reached state pension age






# still get quite alot of annuitisation
# we havent accounted for inflation
# havent tried with housing

# shall we try consumption analysis


# now we have optimal annuity decisions we 
# can make consumption decisions




# mmmmm
# shall i try use these functions on 
# the subjective annuities?
# yeah that sounds fun
