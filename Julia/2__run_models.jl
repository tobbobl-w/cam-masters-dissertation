# # then take individuals from elsa and estimate what consumption should be
# # under the different model types i.e. conditional on assets, age, object live probs and 
# # then both bequests and subjective life probs

# # then we can run regressions on the impact of forced annuitisation

# # there is annuity price data vs income drawdown on fca website which is cool 


# using Statistics
