# Is it better to use the quantecon package and their functions as a starting point or should I instead
# code by hand to get as better understanding of the mechanics of the problem even if it takes longer. 
# Also I should structure this as a julia project from the start otherwise it is going to get messy. 
# what files do I need to do that?
