## Julia files

Files with a prefix of "run" contain code that will solve the models and output results.
These can take awhile so I would run with caution. 

Files with a prefix of "analyse" generally read these in and do something with the result. 

Files with a suffix of "functions" and no "run" or "analyse" prefix contain functions 
and global variables such as the grid size. 

This was my first go at solving lifecycle models and at coding in Julia so please go easy 
on me! Things are really not as fast as they should be.
