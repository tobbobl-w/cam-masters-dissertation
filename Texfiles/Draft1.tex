Standard economic theory suggests that retirement annuities should be highly prized by individuals as a way to
insure against the risk of late death \cite{yaari_65}. However, in developed countries rates of annuitization are far below the
levels that theory predicts. In this paper I test two competing hypotheses for the annuity problem: bequests and
pessimistic life expectancy. Under the coalition government in the UK the law regarding the use of private defined
contribution pensions changed. Individuals were no longer forced to annuitise their pension pots and could access
them in a variety of ways such as lump sum withdrawals or income drawdown and subsequently the number of annuities
sold in the UK dropped precipitously.

Depending on the reason for the lack of annuitization in the UK, the consumption response of retirees to the pension
reform will differ. If individuals do not annuitise because of pessimistic life expectancy I will show that their
consumption should increase. If, on the other hand, individuals do not annuitise because of a bequest motive, consumption
should not change much as a result of the reform. I will solve lifecycle models for both of these cases and simulate
consumption decisions with, and without, forced annuitization. I will then use a variety of empirical models to measure
the consumption change in early retirement that resulted from the policy reform. The size and magnitude of this change
will be indicative of the mechanism causing the annuitization problem.

The importance of retirement policy to individuals in the UK is growing. The number of individuals of
pensionable age is expected to grow from 11.9 million in 2020 to 15.2 million in
2045 according to the latest ONS statistics and for every 1000 people of working age there will be 341 of pensionable
age in 20145 compared to 280 in 2020 \cite{ons_population_predictions_2020}. The increase in absolute and relative
numbers of elderly makes retirement policy more important. Moreover, private, defined contribution (DC), pensions are
becoming increasingly common and are predicted to grow as current cohorts age \cite{cribb_karjalainen_ifs_2023}.
Therefore, policies regarding how private pensions can be accessed will have a larger impact on overall welfare for
retirees.

The so called "pensions freedom act" received Royal Asset in December 2014 marked the end of a series
of pension reforms carried out by the coalition government between 2010 and 2015. The reform was announced
in the Spring budget and made it possible to withdraw money from a private pension pot subject to the
marginal rate of income tax that an individual faced. In the June 2010 budget the government made a first
reform to the annuitization rules, creating an minimum income requirement above which individuals would not need to
annuitise more \cite{finance_act_hmt_2011}. However, this was set at £20,000 and therefore few individuals
were eligible. The minimum income requirement was scrapped in the 2014 bill finally eliminating the
compulsory annuities market. The impact of the reforms on annuity demand has been documented by \cite{cannon_et_al_nier_2016}.
Using data from the Association of British Insurers they show that annuity demand dropped by 75\% from
its maximum.

\subsection{Literature review}
My paper draws on three main strands of literature. The annuity problem, the retirement saving
problem and lifecycle models. \textbf{this intro is rubbish}

\cite{yaari_65} was the first to show that under standard assumptions we would expect individuals to
annuitise all of their wealth at retirement to insure against the risk of long life. Since then there
has been much literature discussing possible reasons that people do not annuitise. \cite{finkelstein_porteba_2002}
and \cite{finkelstein_porteba_2004} find evidence of adverse selection, thereby making the 'money's worth'
of annuities lower for the general population as opposed to the population of annuitants. However, they
also find that theory would still predict annuitization.

\cite{friedman_warshawsky_qje_1990} show that annuitization decisions can be fully explained by a mixture of
bequest motives and actuarily unfair annuities. They solve an augmented life-cycle model with a range of
parameters on how severe the rate of return is on the annuity versus market rates. For plausible values
they find that individuals would optimally not annuitise much wealth. Similarly to \cite{finkelstein_porteba_2004},
\cite{friedman_warshawsky_chicago_1988} show that there is a significant difference between the life expectancy of
annuitants and the general population in the American annuity market but this cannot fully explain the annuitization
problem. Only when bequest motives are added to the model can annuitization rates be rationalized.

\cite{lockwood_red_2012} builds on this and shows that a realistic bequest motive in lifecycle simulations achieves
realistic annuitization rates. He solves a simple lifecycle model with bequest motives taken from several recent papers
in the literature. The bequest motives he picks therefore match other important aspects of the lifecycle model such
as how much individuals actually bequest and how rich individuals are when they bequest.






\cite{mitchell_et_al_1999} - this is empirical
\cite{friedman_warshawsky_qje_1990} - this is theory

\cite{friedman_warshawsky_chicago_1988} - this is more theory. Probably good to have read.

. \textit{Continue
      chat about how elderly population is growing and private pension pots are growing in size, could be worth referencing
      latest census data so we seem super up to date, look at IFS data about the growth of DC pensions as well. }
\textbf{I will do this this afternoon}

                        In some sense the decision to annuitise is a discrete choice problem so I could use something from there.
