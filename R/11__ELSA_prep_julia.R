# we also want to add any other source of income
# higher the income the less likely annuitisation



# So what do we want to do next.
# read in the jsons
# then simulate consumption with assets
# also run with bequest motive
# How do I change the annuity amount without
#  having to run this function thousands of times
#  add another field as income and then add it to the matrix algebra?
#  dont think it would be too much slower but it could take a while to get right
